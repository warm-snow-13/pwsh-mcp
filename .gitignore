# PowerShell MCP: Git ignore rules

# Goal: keep build/test artifacts and local-only files out of Git,
# while allowing configuration and documentation to be versioned.

# Build / distribution
build/
dist/

# Logs
logs/
*.log

# OS / editor clutter
.DS_Store
*.swp
*.swo
.idea/

# Test / coverage data
# XML reports from test and coverage runs (keeps coverage/ folder itself).
**/TestResult.xml
**/TestCoverage.xml
!coverage/.gitkeep

# VS Code configuration files
# VS Code workspace settings are intentionally tracked.
!.vscode/

# CI scripts
!ci.ps1
!jarvis.ps1

# Local draft / sandbox files
.sandbox/
scratch.ps1

# AI assistant sessions and data
.gemini/
.claude/
